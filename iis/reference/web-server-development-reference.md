# Web Server Development Reference
IIS 7 and IIS 8 enable developers to extend IIS to provide custom functionality in new, more powerful ways. IIS extensibility starts with an all-new set of core server APIs, which support module development by using both native-code (C, C++) and managed-code (C#, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../reference/includes/vbprvb-md.md)], C++) languages.  
  
 Although developers can create applications by using familiar technologies such as [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../reference/includes/vstecasp-md.md)], ISAPI, CGI, and so on, they can also take advantage of new features in IIS 7 and IIS 8, such as the new integrated request-processing pipeline.
