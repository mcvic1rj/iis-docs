# Converting Metabase Properties to Configuration Settings
IIS 7.0 XML configuration files replace the IIS 6.0 metabase. The topics in this section use a table format to map the IIS 6.0 metabase properties and WMI provider classes to the new IIS 7.0 configuration schema elements and attributes and WMI provider classes. The topics are arranged alphabetically and cover one or more letters of the alphabet.  
  
 IIS 7.0 continues to support metabase properties that were not replaced by XML configuration schema elements. IIS 7.0 provides way for you to continue using your existing IIS 6.0 management scripts. To do so, you must install the Management Compatibility feature in IIS 7.0. The metabase properties that you can update by using the Management Compatibility feature are noted in the tables.  
  
 Some metabase properties from IIS 6.0 are deprecated. The deprecated metabase properties are those that configured and managed SMTP, NNTP, and FTP. Deprecated properties are noted in the tables.
