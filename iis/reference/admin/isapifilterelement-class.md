## Properties  
 The following table lists the properties exposed by the `IsapiFilterElement` class.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`EnableCache`|A read/write `boolean` value. `true` if IIS allows HTTP.sys caching for requests that go through the ISAPI filter; otherwise, `false`.
