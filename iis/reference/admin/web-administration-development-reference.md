# Web Administration Development Reference
Internet Information Services (IIS) turns a computer into a Web server that can provide HTTP and FTP publishing services. You can use IIS to host and manage Web sites and other Internet content once you obtain an IP address, register your domain on a DNS server, and configure your network appropriately. IIS is a component of the Microsoft WindowsÂ® operating system.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../reference/admin/includes/iisver-md.md)] Web Administration Reference is a resource for administrators and developers who want to directly modify IIS configuration settings or to create applications that manage an IIS server. It also provides information about how to upgrade metabase properties to the new configuration schema and IIS 6.0 WMI scripts to the [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../reference/admin/includes/iisver-md.md)] WMI provider.  
  
## In This Section  
 [IIS Settings Schema](../../reference/admin/iis-settings-schema.md)  
 Describes the elements and attributes in the [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../reference/admin/includes/iisver-md.md)] configuration schema.  
  
 [WMI Provider](../../reference/admin/wmi-provider.md)  
 Describes the classes, methods, and properties of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider.
